I disliked my fridge's water dispenser design. I had to hold the button down for as long as I wanted water to flow from it, thus my tea was always a different strenght because i was too lazy to grab a measuring cup instead of putting the water directly into the kettle. NO, I say! I instead designed a Microchip-based embedded system to serve a few related functions:
Look really cool and promote conversation with anyone in the kitchen for the first time.
Display how much water has been dispensed during the current dispensing.
Interact with user to show them previous dispense amounts (maybe with other info too).
Have user select a predefined amount of water to dispense so that they can walk away and come back to a perfectly full glass!
Most importantly, turn the button into a switch -- I live for the day when I can walk away from my fridge and come back to find it STILL dispensing water, rather than having to wait there for seconds, sometimes minutes at a time.
